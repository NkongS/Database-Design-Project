# Database Design Project
TOPIC : Database for a Bar

ABOUT THE BUSINESS: The business sells drinks to customers. Once customers enter, they will be assigned a unique QR code to their respective tables, which can be scanned to order their drinks and view the drinks menu. The order will then be automatically sent to the bar so that the employee can prepare and serve the drink. Moreover, the order will be stored so customers can see what they have ordered, continue to order, and pay everything at the counter at the end.

PURPOSES: The system with these features generates a unique QR code for each table, an interface for customers to order, an interface for employees to see the menu and order status, an interface for the counter for payment, a database for events, a database for promotion, a database for employees, a database for entry logs, and a database for inventory, which will serve the business as mentioned above.

NOTE:
(1) Design a database that can support at least 2 branches.

(2) At this point, you don’t have to worry about authentication/authorization. (don’t worry about user login/privileges)

(3) You don’t have to create the real application

(4) You have to design the database and create sensible dummy data on those tables

(5) Show your design and ER-Diagram (or another things that you want to describe about your design)

(6) You shall show this (see examples on next slides)
6.1) You shall create MOCK UI of each screen
6.2) Working SQL scripts/functions that are needed for this screen to work
6.3) Show the call results

(7) Create a repository on GitHub. All team members shall regularly contribute (commit code) to the repo. https://github.com/NkongS/Database-Design-Project/tree/main 

(8) Write the summary of the results, criticize your design, suggest for future improvement

(9) Submit a PDF report on Canvas (the report must contain a link to your GitHub repo with clear information indicating
which user is whom in the group).
